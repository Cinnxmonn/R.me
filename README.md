## Term Project
The Term Project SE331 Component-Based Software Development 2<br>
**project-01-the-anti-fake-news-system-check-it-off Phase II** <br>
**Frontend Deployment :** https://the-social-anti-fake-news-system-ph.vercel.app/ <br>
**Backend Deployment :** I have to admit that the backend deployment was not completed because the frontend was deployed but could not connect to the backend. <br>
Ajan may run the backend and frontend separately on machines to test the system.
